# Pong Pi

Pong Pi is a quick imitation of the classic game Pong using Python3 and PyGame

# Setup

If you'd like to run this project yourself, use the following steps:
First, install pygame with pip.
```bash
pip install pygame
```
(if you have multiple versions of python installed, try using ```pip3``` instead)
Next, run the program with Python3.
```bash
python PongPi.py
```
(again, if you have multiple version of Python, use ```python3``` instead)
